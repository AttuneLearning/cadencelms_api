## IMPORTANT NOTE

**Directory Correction:** I was previously working in `/home/adam/github/lms_node/1_LMS_Node_V2` (deprecated directory). All work must be redone in `/home/adam/github/cadencelms_api` (current project).

## Current Status

**Working Directory:** `/home/adam/github/cadencelms_api` ✅

**Tasks to Complete:**
1. ISS-005: Master Department Visibility Fix (needs to be implemented HERE)
2. ISS-001: IPerson Type & Password Change (needs to be implemented HERE)
3. API-001: Fix test suite (in progress)

## API-001: Fix Test Suite

**Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Current Task:** Research authenticate middleware JWT token requirements and fix ISS-005 tests

**Questions:** None currently - researching authenticate middleware
