# ISS-021: Role Permission Updates - Grade Override & Billing Course View

**Created:** 2026-01-14  
**Priority:** High  
**Type:** feature  
**Status:** ⏳ Ready for UI Implementation (contracts updated)

---

## Summary

Update the role permission system to add two new capabilities:
1. **dept-admin** can override/edit student grades (with mandatory change log)
2. **billing-admin** can view courses (list and details) for revenue reporting

---

## Contract Status

| Contract | Status | File |
|----------|--------|------|
| Grade Override Endpoint | ✅ Added | `api/contracts/api/enrollments.contract.ts` |
| Grade History Endpoint | ✅ Added | `api/contracts/api/enrollments.contract.ts` |
| Staff Roles Update | ✅ Updated | `api/contracts/api/roles.contract.ts` |
| API Team Notified | ✅ Sent | `agent_coms/messages/2026-01-14_170000_ui_contract_update_ISS-021.md` |

**UI team can begin implementation immediately against these contracts.**

---

## Background

These updates were identified during the role-function matrix review. The changes align with:
- Separation of concerns (dept-admin handles grade disputes, not instructors)
- Practical needs (billing needs to correlate revenue data with course information)

**Reference Document:** [COURSE_ROLE_FUNCTION_MATRIX.md](../specs/COURSE_ROLE_FUNCTION_MATRIX.md)

## Requirements

### 1. Grade Override for dept-admin

**Capability:** `grade:override`

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Who | dept-admin role only |
| What | Can modify/correct student grades after initial grading |
| Why | Handle grade disputes, correct errors, administrative adjustments |
| Audit | **MANDATORY** - All grade changes must be logged with: timestamp, previous value, new value, reason, admin ID |

**UI Requirements:**
- Grade override UI accessible from student roster or gradebook
- Modal/form requiring reason field (required)
- Display previous grade value for reference
- Confirmation step before saving

**Distinction from instructor grading:**
- `instructor` grades during normal course flow (initial grades)
- `dept-admin` overrides/corrects after the fact (requires justification)

### 2. Course View for billing-admin

**Capability:** `course:view` (full access, not `course:view:financial`)

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| Who | billing-admin role |
| What | Can view course list and course details pages |
| Why | Correlate revenue reports with course information |
| Limits | View ONLY - no edit, no content preview, no module access |

**UI Requirements:**
- `/staff/courses` route accessible to billing-admin
- `/staff/courses/:id` (view) accessible to billing-admin
- No access to: `/staff/courses/:id/edit`, `/staff/courses/:id/modules`, content preview

---

## API Contract Changes Required

### New Endpoint: Grade Override

```
PUT /api/v1/enrollments/:enrollmentId/grades/:gradeId/override
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "newValue": 85.5,
  "reason": "Grade appeal approved by academic committee",
  "previousValue": 72.0
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "gradeId": "grade-123",
  "enrollmentId": "enroll-456",
  "previousValue": 72.0,
  "newValue": 85.5,
  "overrideBy": "user-789",
  "overrideAt": "2026-01-14T15:30:00Z",
  "reason": "Grade appeal approved by academic committee",
  "changeLogId": "log-abc"
}
```

**Required Capability:** `grade:override`

### Updated Capability: billing-admin

Change `course:view:financial` → `course:view` for billing-admin role.

This allows billing-admin to access:
- `GET /api/v1/courses` (list)
- `GET /api/v1/courses/:id` (details)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Grade Change Log Schema

```typescript
interface GradeChangeLog {
  id: string;
  gradeId: string;
  enrollmentId: string;
  courseId: string;
  learnerId: string;
  previousValue: number;
  newValue: number;
  changedBy: string;        // User ID of dept-admin
  changedAt: Date;
  reason: string;           // Required explanation
  changeType: 'override';   // Distinguishes from initial grade
}
```

### Additive Role Behavior

Remember: capabilities are **deduplicated** when combined. If a user has both `instructor` and `dept-admin`, they get:
- `grade` (from instructor) - initial grading
- `grade:override` (from dept-admin) - corrections

These are distinct capabilities, not duplicates.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] dept-admin can access grade override UI
- [ ] Grade override requires reason field (non-empty)
- [ ] All grade overrides are logged to GradeChangeLog
- [ ] billing-admin can access `/staff/courses` route
- [ ] billing-admin can view course details
- [ ] billing-admin CANNOT access course edit, modules, or content preview
- [ ] API endpoint validates `grade:override` capability
- [ ] API endpoint validates `course:view` for billing-admin
