### ISS-016: Certificates Link Label Shows "test-certificates" Instead of "Certificates"

**Priority:** low
**Type:** bug
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED (2026-01-13)
**Assigned:** UI Agent
**Dependencies:** None

**Description:**
The "Certificates" navigation link in the sidebar BASE_NAV_ITEMS is incorrectly labeled as "test-certificates" instead of "Certificates". This appears to be a debugging artifact that was not reverted. The link path (`/learner/certificates`) is correct and should remain in the learner context.

**Current Behavior:**
1. User views sidebar navigation
2. ❌ Link displays as "test-certificates"
3. Link correctly navigates to `/learner/certificates`

**Expected Behavior:**
1. User views sidebar navigation
2. ✅ Link displays as "Certificates"
3. Link navigates to `/learner/certificates` (unchanged)

**Root Cause:**
In [navItems.ts](src/widgets/sidebar/config/navItems.ts#L107), the label was changed from `'Certificates'` to `'test-certificates'`:

```typescript
// Current (incorrect):
{
  label: 'test-certificates',
  path: '/learner/certificates',
  icon: Award,
},

// Expected (correct):
{
  label: 'Certificates',
  path: '/learner/certificates',
  icon: Award,
},
```

**Fix Required:**
Single line change in `navItems.ts` - change `label: 'test-certificates'` to `label: 'Certificates'`.
