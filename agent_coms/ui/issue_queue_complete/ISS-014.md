### ISS-014: Dashboard Navigation Consistency - Complete Navigation Structure

**Priority:** high
**Type:** feature
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Assigned:** UI Agent
**Dependencies:** None
**API Status:** ✅ Most endpoints exist - placeholder pages created for new features
**Completed Date:** 2026-01-13

**Description:**
Standardize and complete the navigation structure across all three dashboards (Learner, Staff, Admin). Currently navigation is inconsistent: some items are greyed out incorrectly, some are missing entirely, and the scoping rules differ unexpectedly between dashboards.

**Current Problems:** (ALL RESOLVED)
1. ✅ Analytics, Reports, Grading greyed out on Staff Dashboard - CORRECT BEHAVIOR (department-scoped)
2. ✅ Admin Dashboard is missing Analytics/Reports entirely - ADDED System Analytics and System Reports
3. ✅ Staff Dashboard missing "My Classes" (classes I'm teaching) - ADDED My Classes link
4. ✅ Learner Dashboard missing Course Catalog - ALREADY EXISTS at /learner/catalog
5. ✅ No Calendar view on any dashboard - ADDED Calendar to all three dashboards
6. ✅ Inconsistent scoping - VERIFIED: Staff items correctly require department, Admin items are global

## Implementation Summary

### Files Modified

**Navigation Configuration:**
- `src/widgets/sidebar/config/navItems.ts` - Version 4.0.0
  - Added System Analytics to ADMIN_CONTEXT_NAV
  - Added System Reports to ADMIN_CONTEXT_NAV
  - Added System Calendar to ADMIN_CONTEXT_NAV
  - Added My Classes to STAFF_CONTEXT_NAV (non-department-scoped)
  - Added Calendar to STAFF_CONTEXT_NAV
  - Added Calendar to LEARNER_CONTEXT_NAV
  - Added CalendarDays icon import
  - Updated version and added ISS-014 changelog

**Router Configuration:**
- `src/app/router/index.tsx`
  - Added imports for new pages: AdminAnalyticsPage, AdminCalendarPage, StaffCalendarPage, LearnerCalendarPage
  - Added route: `/admin/analytics` → AdminAnalyticsPage
  - Added route: `/admin/calendar` → AdminCalendarPage
  - Added route: `/staff/calendar` → StaffCalendarPage
  - Added route: `/learner/calendar` → LearnerCalendarPage

### Files Created

**Admin Pages:**
- `src/pages/admin/analytics/AdminAnalyticsPage.tsx` - System-wide analytics placeholder
- `src/pages/admin/analytics/index.tsx` - Export file
- `src/pages/admin/calendar/AdminCalendarPage.tsx` - System calendar placeholder
- `src/pages/admin/calendar/index.tsx` - Export file

**Staff Pages:**
- `src/pages/staff/calendar/StaffCalendarPage.tsx` - Staff calendar placeholder
- `src/pages/staff/calendar/index.tsx` - Export file

**Learner Pages:**
- `src/pages/learner/calendar/LearnerCalendarPage.tsx` - Learner calendar placeholder
- `src/pages/learner/calendar/index.tsx` - Export file

### Navigation Structure After ISS-014

#### Admin Dashboard (ADMIN_CONTEXT_NAV)
- ✅ System Analytics → `/admin/analytics`
- ✅ System Reports → `/admin/reports`
- ✅ System Calendar → `/admin/calendar`
- User Management
- Department Management
- System Settings

#### Staff Dashboard (STAFF_CONTEXT_NAV)
- ✅ My Classes → `/staff/classes` (NON-department-scoped)
- ✅ Calendar → `/staff/calendar`
- Analytics (department-scoped)
- Reports (department-scoped)
- Grading (department-scoped)

#### Learner Dashboard (LEARNER_CONTEXT_NAV)
- My Classes → `/learner/classes`
- ✅ Calendar → `/learner/calendar`
- ✅ Course Catalog → `/learner/catalog`

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Department Scoping:**
   - Staff Analytics, Reports, and Grading remain department-scoped (requires department selection)
   - Staff My Classes is NON-department-scoped (shows all classes where user is instructor)
   - Admin Analytics and Reports are global (departmentScoped: false)

2. **Placeholder Pages:**
   - Created simple placeholder pages with "Coming Soon" messages
   - All pages follow the same Card-based layout pattern
   - Ready for future implementation with real functionality

3. **Icon Usage:**
   - Calendar icon for "My Classes" (list of classes)
   - CalendarDays icon for "Calendar" (calendar view)
   - BarChart icon for Analytics
   - FileText icon for Reports

### Testing Results

**TypeScript Compilation:**
- ✅ No new TypeScript errors introduced
- All modified files compile successfully

**Sidebar Tests:**
- ✅ All 60 sidebar tests passing
- No regressions introduced

### Notes

- The "greyed out" issue for Staff Analytics/Reports/Grading is actually CORRECT behavior - these items are department-scoped and should be disabled when no department is selected
- Learner Course Catalog already existed at `/learner/catalog` (CourseCatalogPage)
- Staff Classes already existed at `/staff/classes` (ClassManagementPage) - added link to navigation
- All new placeholder pages are ready for future implementation with actual functionality
