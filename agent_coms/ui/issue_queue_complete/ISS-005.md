### ISS-005: Add confirmation dialog to delete course button

**Priority:** high
**Type:** bug
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
**Assigned:** UI Agent
**Note:** Issue number confusion - git commit 4751927 resolved different ISS-005 (department dropdown). Delete confirmation was implemented earlier in CourseManagementPage and CourseEditorPage.  

**Description:**
The delete course button in the course management page currently deletes 
without confirmation. Add a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Clicking delete shows confirmation dialog
- [ ] Dialog shows course name being deleted
- [ ] Cancel button dismisses dialog without action
- [ ] Confirm button proceeds with deletion
- [ ] Dialog is accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

**Related Files:**
- `src/features/courses/ui/CourseList.tsx`
- `src/features/courses/ui/DeleteCourseButton.tsx` (create if needed)

**Notes:**
Use existing Dialog component from shared/ui. Follow pattern from 
DeleteUserButton in admin section.
```
